# Dolphin
This repository contains the necessary files to build the Dolphin Smalltalk Core Images from a pre-built boot image. Executables for the various virtual machine
components are included, so it is not necessary to compile these from source unless you need to. Please see [Getting Started](http://www.object-arts.com/gettingstarted.html)
on the Object Arts website for more details.
