BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY, AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY, TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT CLICK THE "DO NOT ACCEPT" BUTTON AND DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE.

LICENSE IN A NUTSHELL.

The full license agreement follows. This paragraph contains the "spirit" of the agreement in an easy to read summary and is provided as a convenience to you. It does not form part of the agreement itself.

This license is an extension to the original Dolphin Development License that you agreed to when installing Dolphin Smalltalk. By agreeing to this you are entitled to install and use the Dolphin Smalltalk Web Deployment Kit on a single computer. You may use it to create binary applications (applets) in the form of Dolphin Binary Package files (PAKs), and you may distribute these applets for commercial purposes or otherwise. In general, such an applet will run inside a web browser hosted by the Dolphin Web Applet Plug-in but it is not limited to this execution environment. If you have a license to the Dolphin Smalltalk Application Deployment Kit (ADK) then you may create additional execution environments for your Dolphin applets.

The full text of the license agreement follows.
