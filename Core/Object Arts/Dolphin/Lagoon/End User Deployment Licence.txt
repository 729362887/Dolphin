LICENSE IN A NUTSHELL.

The full license agreement follows. This paragraph contains the "spirit" of the agreement in an easy to read summary and is provided as a convenience to you. It does not form part of the agreement itself.

This license is an extension to the original Dolphin Development License that you agreed to when installing Dolphin Smalltalk. By agreeing to this you are entitled to install and use the Dolphin Smalltalk Application Deployment Kit on a single computer. You may use it to create executable files (EXEs) for applications you have written using Dolphin and you may distribute these applications for commercial purposes or otherwise. In addition, you may supply, together with your application files, a number of Dolphin's redistributable files that will be required for the application to run successfully on a target computer.
 
The full text of the license agreement follows.
