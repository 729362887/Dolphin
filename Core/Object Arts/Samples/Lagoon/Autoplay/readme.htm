<p>Welcome to the Dolphin Smalltalk Professional Try-Buy CD.</p>
<p>On this disk you will find two trial versions of Dolphin Smalltalk™; the
premier Smalltalk development system for Microsoft Windows™. Please see the
sections below for a review of these two different products. First of all,
though, just a note about the Microsoft Windows Installer.</p>
<hr>
<h2><font color="#9999FF">Windows Installer</font></h2>
<p>All of the installations on the CD make use of the Microsoft Windows
Installer mechanism. This has a number of advantages compared with earlier setup
technology which means that installations should be easier and more robust. To
make use of the MSI you must have an appropriate version of the Windows
Installer (1.1) available on your machine before attempting to install any of
the downloads on this page. Note that your operating system may already have MSI
available, either because it came as part of the OS or because another
application has installed it. If you are not sure, and want to save on
additional download time, try the Dolphin product links first to see if the MSI
file type is recognized by your system and can be opened as an installation
file. If it is not, then use one of the following links to update your version
of Microsoft Windows to the new installer now.</p>

Professional+Source Tracking System</font></h2>
<p>This is version of Dolphin Smalltalk Professional that has been pre-loaded
with STS (Source Tracking System)- an ENVY™-like clone specially written for
the Dolphin environment. </p>

made. Features include browsing of old method/class/package/project/view
editions, comparing changes between them, loading partial code from packages
without installing them, merging code from different package editions and team
development support. Source Tracking System also introduces projects into the
Dolphin Smalltalk environment with which you can group multiple package versions
together and load them all at once in a predefined order.</p>
<p>STS is available as an add-on to Dolphin from <a href="http://www.gorisek.com">http://www.gorisek.com</a>.
